# CS231-Project2
Second CS Project

This project is about using cellular automaton to model Conway's game of life. 
There is also an extension file that contains the classes I made to model a Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction by also using cellular automotan

LifeSimulation doesn't take any command line arguments 

BZSimulation takes optional command line arguments

Usage:

BZSimulation [alpha] [beta] [gamma]

Note:

All command line arguments must be between 0 and 1!
